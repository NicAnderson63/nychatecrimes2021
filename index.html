<p> The New York Police Department’s Hate Crime Task Force (HCTF) began tracking hate crimes in New York City in 2017. The department’s most recent reports show that the number of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes tripled from 2020 to 2021. </p>

<p> LGBTQ+ citizens and businesses in New York Ciy have been targets of recent hate attacks. On Nov. 19, a man threw a huge rock in front of Vers, a gay bar in Hells Kitchen. In April, RASH, a Bushwick bar was  set on fire and a few months before, the Bossa Nova Civic Club down the block was set on fire and C’Mon Everbody in Bed Stuy had  a brick was thrown through a window, to name a few. </p>

<p> “A hate crime is not a separate crime,” Oren Yaniv, a spokesperson with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office said. “It is what we call an enhancement.” </p>

<p> Yaniv explained hate crimes add an additional layer to whatever the initial crime that was committed. </p>


<p> The HCTF is an extension of the NYPD that works with district attorneys to investigate and prosecute crimes, in addition to being responsible for publishing the hate crime data available to the public.  </p>


<p> “Not every incident can lead to an arrest, and not every arrest will result in a hate crime case. Prosecutors are bound by the law and the facts of a particular case,” Kay Nguyen, a spokesperson at the Manhattan District Attorney’s office said. “If we can’t prove a hate crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then it is our ethical duty to not charge it as such.”</p>

<p> These numbers may not tell the whole story because it is unknown how many hate crimes in New York City go unreported per year. </p>


<p> The mayor’s office had no comment and the NYPD was unavailable for comment at the time. </p>
