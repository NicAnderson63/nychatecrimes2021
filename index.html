<h5> Hate crimes in New York City are at the highest they have been since the Hate Crime Task Force (HCTFU) began tracking these numbers in 2017. Manhattan and Brooklyn have the highest numbers in the borough.</h5>


<p> “A hate crime is not a separate crime,” Oren Yaniv, a spokesperson with the Brooklyn District Attorney’s office said. “It is what we call an enhancement.” </p>

<p> Yaniv explained hate crimes add an additional layer to whatever the initial crime that was committed. The district attorneys offices oly become aware of a hate crime after the NYPD's HCTFU unit determined the incident was a hate crime. </p>


<p> The HCTFU is an extension of the NYPD that works with district attorneys to investigate and prosecute crimes, in addition to being responsible for publishing the hate crime data available to the public.  </p>


<p> “Not every incident can lead to an arrest, and not every arrest will result in a hate crime case. Prosecutors are bound by the law and the facts of a particular case,” Kay Nguyen, a spokesperson at the Manhattan District Attorney’s office said. “If we can’t prove a hate crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then it is our ethical duty to not charge it as such.”</p>

<p> These numbers may not tell the whole story because it is unknown how many hate crimes in New York City go unreported per year. </p>

<p> The NYPD was unavailable for comment at the time. </p>
